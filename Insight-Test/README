Multi-player blackjack game
----------------------------

The game allows multiple players to play blackjack.
The game has the following steps:

Step 1: Enter the number of players and name of players.

Step 2: Ask if the players want to quit or play
        If the player wants to play then they place a bet
	The bet should be less than the balance and at least 1.

Step 3: 2 cards are dealt to all players. 

Step 4: Ask each player if he wants more cards. Give more cards 
        till the player decides to stand or he busts (total more than 21)
        or he gets blackjack.

Step 5: The dealer hits cards till he gets a total more than 16. 

Step 6: If all player have bust, then start a new round.

        and all non-busted players with total less than dealer lose.
